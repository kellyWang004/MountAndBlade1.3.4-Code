  If we're agreed, I'll go pick a few herbs for the road, maybe also try the apothecary. There's some barks that are good for fevers, and flax for poultices. A bit of aloe to help the healing, lemon and aquavit to clean wounds - and opium, of course" />

  Rhagaea's philosophy:
  Whoever wins this war, landlords will cheat tenants, city guards will demand bribes from merchants, warriors will rape farmers' daughters, husbands will beat wives. The plague and the flux will take more lives than all the evils of man put together.
  I will strive to be a good queen, but I can offer no guarantee that my heir, or my heir's heir, will not be a monster. 
  I could marry Lucon or Gario, and save thousands of lives. But men are willing to fight for me, though it gains them nothing, for no other reason that the throne is my right. I will not betray these men.
  People will think back on my victory and think, "Heavens smile on those who are in the right."
